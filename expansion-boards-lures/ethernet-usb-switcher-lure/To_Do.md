To do list

Use Diptrace 2.9 Beta or wait for final relase to make use of the Differential Pairs utility. 

Move Ethernet and USB ports so they are closer together in order to keep the data paths shorter.

Use a separate transistor to drive each relay in order to prevent overloading the 2 transistors in darlington array.  

Done:
- Make power paths bigger to prevent power issues if 1 OZ copper manufacturing process is choosen(Which is the most common). 
- Remove the 5V regulator as it is an overkill part of the design.
