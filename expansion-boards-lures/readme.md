Breakout boards called "Lures" expand functionality of the MinnowBoard MAX by connecting to either the low- or high-speed
expansion connectors. Lures are owned and supported by their respective owners and manufacturers. The community can give 
you best effort support; issues should be taken to the respective manufacturers and designers.
